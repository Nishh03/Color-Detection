# color-detection
This project uses OpenCV and Pandas to detect and display the name of the color in an image upon double-clicking on it. It utilizes a pre-defined CSV file containing color names and their corresponding RGB values to find and display the closest matching color name.


**Features**
-Color Detection: Double-click on any point in the image to detect and display the color name along with its RGB values.
-Interactive Interface: The application shows the detected color name and its RGB values in a rectangle at the top of the image.
-CSV Color Data: Utilizes a CSV file (colors.csv) that contains color names and their RGB values for matching.
